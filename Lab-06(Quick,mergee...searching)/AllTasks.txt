Task 1:
Given the array in the above-mentioned figure implement quick sort that simply chooses the middle
element as the pivot and sort accordingly.


Task 2:
Given an array in the above figure of integers, sort the array in ascending as well as
descending order and return it using radix sort


Task 3
Given an array of integers in the above mentioned figure, sort the array in ascending as well as
descending order and return it using Merge sort.

Task 4:
Implement the above array, sort it and find the value corresponding to to your last two digits of the roll number
(if its not in the array add a value somewhere in between the array) and find it via binary search.

Tasks 5:
Write code for interpolation and show the iterations for uniformly
distributed array.
Note: An array is considered as uniformly distributed when the difference
between the elements is equal or almost same. Example 1: 1,2,3,4,5,6
(Difference is 1)
