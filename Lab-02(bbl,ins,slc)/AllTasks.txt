1- Given an array of strings arr[]. Sort given strings using Bubble Sort and display the sorted array.
Take array[10]= {5,1,3,6,2,9,7,4,8,10}

2- Develop C++ solution such that day month and year are taken as input for 5 records and perform
Sorting Dates based on year using Selection Sort. Note: Input must be taken from user
Example Input: Example Output:
01/02/2022 4/07/2015
5/01/2018 5/01/2018
4/07/2015 12/10/2021
12/10/2021 01/02/2022
11/12/2023 11/12/2023

3- In a bustling corporate office, the facilities management team is tasked with organizing the seating
arrangements for employees based on their designations. The office layout consists of rows of
computer desks, and each desk has a designated employee.
The priority is to sort out the computer desks for employees using the Insertion Sort algorithm, with the
designation determining the sorting order. The higher the designation, the closer the employee should
be seated to the corner office. The designations and their corresponding priorities are as follows:
1. CEO (Chief Executive Officer) - Highest Priority
2. CTO (Chief Technology Officer)
3. CFO (Chief Financial Officer)
4. VP (Vice President)
5. MGR (Manager)
6. EMP (Employee) - Lowest Priority
Here&#39;s the initial arrangement of employees&#39; desks from left to right:
1. Employee (EMP)
2. CFO (Chief Financial Officer)
3. Manager (MGR)
4. Employee (EMP)
5. VP (Vice President)
6. CTO (Chief Technology Officer)
7. Manager (MGR)
8. CEO (Chief Executive Officer)

4- Attempt to do task 2 but with an Recursive approach.

5- A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of rearranging a number of large
crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low
relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly full: there is
extra space sufficient to hold any one of the crates, but not two. Which sorting method should
the clerk use? Implement this question via a user generated array?
