Q1: Implement and insert the values “BORROWROB” in the stack and identify if it’s a
palindrome or not. Use the push and pop functions to accomplish this (Note: Use Arrays to
accomplish this)


Q2. Implement a Queue based approach where assume you are the cashier in a supermarket and
you need to make checkouts. Customer ID’s Are 13,7,4,1,6,8,10. (Note: Use Arrays to
accomplish this task with enqueue and dequeue)


Q3. Consider you have an expression x=12+13-5(0.5+0.5) +1 which results to 20. Implement a
stack-based implementation to solve this question via linked lists (linked lists can be single or
double) and the resulted output must be at the top of the stack. Note that the x and the equal sign
must be present in the stack and when inserting the top value (20 result) all the values must be
present in the stack (You can pop and push them accordingly)


Q4: In Table 1 Given above your are given an infix notation of ((a+b)*c)-d and you are required
to convert it into postfix notation. Attempt to solve the question using queues and linked lists.
(Assume a Tree when solving this approach)


Q5. In a cloud computing system, tasks are submitted by users for processing on a server. Each
task is characterized by its estimated execution time (in minutes) and resource requirements,
including CPU usage, memory, and storage. The server employs a queue-based job scheduling
algorithm to manage the execution of these tasks efficiently.
TaskID | Execution Time | CPU Usage (%) | Memory (MB) |Storage (GB)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | 20 | 30 | 512 | 2 |
2 | 15 | 20 | 256 | 1 |
3 | 25 | 40 | 768 | 3 |
4 | 18 | 25 | 384 | 2 |
Assume the server has a single queue for processing tasks. Additionally, there are three virtual
machines (VMs) available for task execution, each with the following resources:
CPU: 60%, Memory: 1024 MB, Storage: 5 GB. Build a priority queue based approach using

linked-lists and dequeue the elements in such a way that the resources are utilized optimally and
all the tasks are executed.
